# ![ROMeo](logo.png?raw=true "ROMeo logo") Database
A locally hostable, simple, light webapp to manage online download links for videogame roms, stored in JSON file databases.

The webapp must be hosted in order to correctly fetch local files, this can be done by the use of a simple Apache2 httpd daemon.

Download default game ROMs lists from the [ROMeo-JSON](https://github.com/Ascaniolamp/ROMeo-JSON) repo and follow the instructions to customize your installation.
